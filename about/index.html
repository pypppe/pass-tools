    <h1>About Password Tools V2.0</h1>

    <p>
      Password Tools V2.0 is a website designed for people that want to keep their password very secure, and encrypted.
      Password Tools V2.0 is a fork of Stormy45's, Pass Tools on GitHub before their account was flagged.
      However, our version is created with a much secure system, and comfortable to the eye design.
      We work by using JavaScript and LocalStorage.
      LocalStorage is not a database, and not a server.
      It's more like a server only you can access, and only you.
      We can ensure that we cannot see what passwords you have, what passwords you generated,
      and what is in your LocalStorage.
      This is because we think privacy is a fundamental right.
